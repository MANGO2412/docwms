# Introduction

E-commerce has experienced accelerated growth since 2019, according to reports from platforms like SAP. This boom has put strong pressure on third-party logistics (3PL) providers and carriers, who must deliver orders quickly and efficiently, following standards similar to those of leading companies like Amazon.

In this context, WMS (Warehouse Management System) systems have become essential. These solutions allow for the optimization of all processes within a warehouse: from receiving and *put away*, to picking, packing, shipping, tracking, and inventory replenishment. All of this is managed from a single, centralized interface, which improves operational efficiency and logistical control.

## What is a WMS and how does it work?

A WMS (Warehouse Management System) is a software solution designed to manage and control the movement of goods within a warehouse. Its main goal is to optimize the order *fulfillment* cycle, ensuring that products enter and leave the warehouse in an organized and efficient manner.

The process begins when a customer generates a *fulfillment* order. The system automatically checks for inventory availability. If there is no stock, a request is generated to meet the demand.

Once the supplier sends the products to G Global's warehouses, the system detects the packages, registers them, and prepares them to be used in orders. Then, these orders go through internal flows like **picking** and **packing**. When these flows are completed, the system validates that the products are ready for shipment.

Finally, the orders are dispatched, closing the *fulfillment* cycle. This flow is repeated every time a new order is generated.

## G Global's WMS Platform: Client Environment and Internal Environment

**G Global's** WMS is structured into two independent environments, designed to meet different needs:

- **Client Environment (WMS Portal):** Aimed at suppliers and clients. From this portal, you can:
  - View real-time inventory.
  - Generate and track *fulfillment* orders.
  - Consult logistics reports.
  - Register returns and incidents.

- **Internal Environment (WMS Operation):** Used by G Global's logistics staff to manage the warehouse's operational processes, such as:
  - Receiving merchandise.
  - Put Away.
  - Picking.
  - Packing.
  - Shipping.
  - Auditing and quality control.

This division ensures that clients have visibility and control over their operations, while G Global guarantees an agile, organized operational flow with real-time traceability.

## Why this manual?

G-WMS is constantly evolving, adapting to the needs of its clients and optimizing internal operations. For this reason, this **user manual** has been developed to explain all the functionalities the system offers and to help you make the most of it in both environments.
