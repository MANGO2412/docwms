# Item Master

This module allows you to manage client items in the WMS, detailing the necessary actions to register a product, as well as to update or delete its information in the system. It's considered one of the most important modules, as the information generated here is relevant for other modules within the WMS.

- The registration form includes some optional settings in the form of checkboxes. These options are disabled by default, but if you want to activate any functionality related to the product, simply check the corresponding box. Below are the available options that can be configured for each product:

    - **Self Expeditable**: Allows the item to be entered directly and pass the initial validation without needing to scan the box first.
    - **Filling**: Prevents the item from being picked or automatically scanned in SLAM if it does not have a UPC code. In these cases, the code must be entered manually.
    - **Lot Validation**: Activates lot number validation within the SLAM application.
    - **Show Lot in SLAM**: Enables the display of the item's lot number during the SLAM process.
    - **Activable**: Adds an additional validation in SLAM. When this option is activated, the form will request a verification code. This validation is executed when the item's UPC is scanned.
