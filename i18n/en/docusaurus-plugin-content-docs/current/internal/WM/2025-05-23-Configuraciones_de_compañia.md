# Company Settings

This section details the configuration options available for registered WMS clients. These settings allow defining system behavior in fulfillment workflows (such as picking and packing operations), as well as enabling or disabling specific validations for inventory movements or picker processes, among other key adjustments.

## Theme Configuration

This section defines the color theme and client logo, essential elements for the final design of the web portal. This configuration can be customized if required by the client, allowing the portal's appearance to match their visual identity.

üîç **How to access?**

1. Log in to the WMS web portal.  
2. Ensure you have access to the **Companies** module.  
3. Within the module, select a client by double-clicking their record in the table.  
4. Click the **Theme** tab to display available options.

Below are the options you can modify in this section:

- **Client Logo**:  
  At the top, you can assign or change the client's logo. The system requires at least two images to complete this configuration.

- **Color Palette**:  
  Next, you must define a color palette. This option adapts the portal's visual design to the client's graphic style.  
  You need to configure **primary** and **secondary** colors for both light and dark themes.  
  Color selection is done via a **color picker**, which allows dragging within a visual scheme and provides the corresponding hexadecimal value in real time.

## Inventory Configuration

This section lets you set key configurations for inventory behavior, specifically related to **multiple SKUs per location**, **Country of Origin (COO) change rules**, and **replenishment priorities**.

üîç **How to access?**
1. Log in to the WMS web portal.
2. Ensure you have access to the **Companies** module.
3. Within the module, select a client by double-clicking their record in the table.
4. Click the **Inventory** tab to display available options.

Below are the adjustable configurations:

üîπ **Enable Location with Multiple SKU**  
This option allows a location to contain multiple distinct SKUs.  
Useful for multi-SKU locations or consolidations (enable if needed).

üîπ **Multiple Lots in Containers**  
Allows storing more than one lot number per container. If you handle products with different lots, this option helps manage them from the same location.

üî∏ **COO Location Change Rule**  

Defines system behavior when updating a location's Country of Origin (COO):  
- **Always update COO**: Always updates the location's COO, regardless of whether it already has one.  
- **Only update if location has no COO**: Only assigns a COO if the location doesn't have one yet.

üî∏ **Replenishment COO Prioritization**  

Sets a priority order for inventory replenishment based on Country of Origin.  
- **Configuration: Yes / No**  
  Enable this option to activate prioritization.  

  ![](/img/upload/Clientsp3-2025-13-16.png)  

- **Select a Country**  
  Use the search bar to add countries by name or code (e.g., China (CN), Thailand (TH)).  

  ![](/img/upload/Clientsp4-2025-13-16.png)  

  :::warning  
  Selecting **"Any Country"** tells the system that if insufficient inventory exists in the **Priority Order** list, it can pull products from any available country in the warehouse. This also applies if packages are received from a country not on the list.  
  :::  

- **Priority Order**  
  Arrange countries by desired replenishment priority. The system will prioritize countries higher on the list.  

  ![](/img/upload/Clientsp5-2025-13-16.png)  

  :::tip  
  Drag and drop items to reorder the list based on client needs.  
  :::  

- **One COO at a Time at Pick Locations**  
  If enabled, each picking location can only contain products from one COO at a time, preventing non-compliant combinations that may affect traceability.

## Picker Configuration  

This section customizes the visibility and behavior of the **Picker App** for a specific client. Here, you can define displayed information, assignable tote types, validations, and AQL (Acceptable Quality Limit) sampling.  

<h2>üîç How to Access?</h2>  
1. Log in to the WMS web portal.  
2. Ensure you have access to the **Companies** module.  
3. Within the module, select a client by double-clicking their record in the table.

<h2>üî∏Configurations</h2>  

Defines additional rules to control app behavior:  

- **By UPC**: Enables UPC-based validation or search.  
- **Show Locations**: Displays available warehouse locations.

üî∏ **AQL Sampling**  

This slider configures the percentage of items to be validated via AQL (Acceptable Quality Limit) sampling.  

![](/img/upload/Clientsp11-2025-13-16.png)  

:::note  
Example: A 50% value means the system will prompt validation for half of the items scanned by the picker.
