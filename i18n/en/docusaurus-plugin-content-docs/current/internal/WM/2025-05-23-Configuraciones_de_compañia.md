# Company Settings

This section outlines the configuration settings available for clients registered in the WMS. These settings allow you to define system behavior for fulfillment workflows (including picking and packing operations), as well as enable or disable specific validations for inventory movements or picker processes, among other key adjustments.

 üîç **How to access?**

Available configurations:

üîπ **Enable Location with Multiple SKU**
Allows a location to contain multiple distinct SKUs.
Useful for multi-SKU locations or consolidations (enable if needed).

üîπ **Multiple lots in containers**
Allows storing more than one lot number per container. Helpful when working with products arriving in different lots that need management from the same location.

üî∏ **COO Location Change Rule**

Defines system behavior when updating a location's Country of Origin:
- **Always update COO**: Always updates the location's COO, regardless of any existing value
- **Only update if location has no COO**: Only assigns a COO if the location doesn't have one already

üî∏ **Replenishment COO Prioritization**

Sets priority order for inventory replenishment based on Country of Origin:
- **Configuration: Yes / No**
    Enable this option to activate prioritization

- **Select a country**
    Use search to add countries by name or code (e.g. China (CN), Thailand (TH))

    ![](/img/upload/Clientsp4-2025-13-16.png)

    :::warning
    Selecting **"Any Country"** tells the system that when inventory isn't available in countries defined in the **Priority Order** list, it can take products from any other available country in the warehouse. This also applies if packages are received from a country not included in the list.
    :::

- **Priority Order**
    Arrange countries according to desired stock replenishment priority. The system will try the highest priority country first.

  :::tip
   You can reorder the list by simply dragging and dropping elements, depending on customer needs.
  :::

- **One COO at a time at Pick Locations**
    When enabled, each picking location can only contain products from one COO at a time, preventing non-compliant combinations that might affect traceability.

üî∏ **AQL Sampling**

This slider configures the percentage of items to be validated via AQL (Acceptable Quality Limit) sampling.

:::note
For example, setting 50% means the system will require validation for half of items scanned by the picker.
