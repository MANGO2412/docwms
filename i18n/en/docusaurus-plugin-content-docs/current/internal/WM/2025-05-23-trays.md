# Trays

This module manages the administration of trays, which are fundamental in the system as they are responsible for storing assigned items required to fulfill orders generated in the Order Monitor module of each warehouse. Here we describe the necessary steps to register, update, and delete trays, as well as generate sizes that provide greater detail about them.

## Generate a Tray

- Click on the following marked option to begin the tray generation process.
