### Create a Guide

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><h3>Steps</h3></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
           **Click** on **1** in the **general interface** to **open** a **form**. In this form enter data such as: **guide name** and **description**. Ignore the URL field.

           If specific **package dimensions** are required, you can **set them** (e.g., 10x10x10).

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-110208.png)

           Next, click the blue button labeled **ADD RULE** to add rules. Rules consist of **3 factors**: 1\. **Field** where the rule is applied, 2\. The **operator** indicating how to search for the keyword, 3\. The **keyword**. Rules can also be **deleted**.

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-110755.png)

           To understand how rules work, consider this example: A company called Hitachi is working with G-Global but wants special attention given to laptop packaging to ensure customer satisfaction. They need to provide packaging instructions to staff when using SLAM, specifically for certain product campaigns containing their computers. Here's how to solve this:

           First add the guide name and description as shown earlier, plus any required box/container dimensions.

           Then click the first **field** dropdown to see options:

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-111918.png)

           Since the client wants these guides applied to specific campaigns, select **Campaign**.

           Next is the **operator** for searching the **keyword** that **triggers** this **guide**. Select **contains** because the campaign name is **LaptopHitachiEmbalaje** (the campaign name contains the keyword).

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-112138.png)

           Finally, enter the **keyword** that must be **contained** in the **campaign name** to **execute** this guide. In this case: **HitachiEmbalaje**.

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-112511.png)

           This creates one rule for a campaign. To apply to **more campaigns**, create **additional rules**, or use **SKU** as the indicator for specific products.  
           **To delete a rule**, use the **trash can icon** on the right.

           The final step is to **add** the **packaging guide** (must be a **PDF file** - **only PDF format is accepted**).

           Add the guide as follows:

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-113155.png)

           Click **SELECT FILE** to **open a folder** showing only **.pdf files** (the **only accepted format**).

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-113755.png)

           Select the packaging manual, then click **open** (or double-click).

           When the **file is selected**, it will appear like this:

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-114108.png)

           Finally, click **finish** to **create** the **new** guide.

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Edit a Guide

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><h3>Steps</h3></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
           **Click** on **3** in the **general interface** to **open** the guide's **edit form**.

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-30-100420.png)

           Editing a guide follows the **same process** as **creating** one, so refer to that tutorial.

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Delete a Guide

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><h3>Steps</h3></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
           **Click** on **4** in the **general interface** to delete a guide. A confirmation box will appear - click **OK** to **confirm deletion**.

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-115722.png)

           The guide will then be removed (note its absence from the table):

           ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-10-115838.png)
        </td>
    </tr>
