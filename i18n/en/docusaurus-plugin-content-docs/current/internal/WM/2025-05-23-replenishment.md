# Replenishment Module

The replenishment module is used to restock locations with items that are needed.
This module creates a replenishment order, which can later be processed in the replenishment module itself, where data such as the container where the items are located, the items, and the location where the replenishment will be done must be entered.
In this module, you can also delete and process open replenishment orders.

## Module Details

Replenishment orders have several statuses that reflect the current progress of that order. These statuses are listed below:

<ol>
  <li><mark style={{backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white'}}>(On Queue)</mark> - This status means the order is in queue.</li>
  <li><mark style={{backgroundColor: 'yellow'}}>(In Progress)</mark> - This status means the order is in progress.</li>
  <li><mark style={{backgroundColor: 'green'}}>(Completed)</mark> - This status means the order has been completed.</li>
  <li><mark style={{backgroundColor: 'red', color: 'white'}}>(Cancelled)</mark> - This status means the order has been cancelled.</li>
</ol>

        <th><h3>Context</h3></th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            The first thing added when using replenishment is the container, which is the box where one or several items are stored. A container typically looks like this:

            ![logo](/img/upload/screenshot-2025-06-24-122218.png)

            **Items** usually come in different presentations, but one of the most common is smaller boxes.

            ![](/img/upload/screenshot-2025-05-20-100053.png)

            The **location** is where items can be stored for use in the process. This location is a space on a warehouse rack and is represented by a **label** with a **QR code**, which is placed on that rack.

### Create Replenishment

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><b>Steps</b></th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            Select <b>3</b> from the main interface to start the process of creating a new replenishment. An interface will appear where the order will be created.
            
             ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-101708.png)

             In this **interface**, there are two ways to create a Replenishment when selecting the **type** field. As the most **common** option, we will select **Manual**, so planning remains **empty** by default.

             ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-102011.png)

             Then click **ADD**, and the replenishment **order** will be **created**. This will be represented as follows:
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-102231.png)

            Here you can see how the **order** was **created** and **listed**. Once created, the order is ready to be processed.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><b>Steps</b></th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            The first step is to **double-click** a newly **created** replenishment order with a status of **OnQueue**.

            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-102231.png)

            Then the order processing page will open. 

            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-07-04-115612.png)

            First, you need to create a **pending task** to indicate the item to be moved. **Click** on Pending **tasks**, located in the top-left corner as the first button.

            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-07-04-115914.png)

            Upon clicking, a **form** will appear where you will **specify** the **item** to move, the **quantity**, and the **zone**. The **zone** where the item is located should only be entered if explicitly requested; otherwise, it can be left blank.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-113023.png)

            When entering the **SKU** of the item, **make sure** to **select** the SKU from the **results list**; otherwise, the operation **cannot** be performed.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-125002.png)

            Once the task is completed, click **assign tasks**.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-113101.png)

            This task will be reflected in the table at the bottom.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-113243.png)
            
            Every time you create or assign a task, this type of movement is reflected in the replenishment order history, which is **located** at the **bottom** of the order processing interface.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-115920.png)

            Once this is done, select the **movement type**, either **SKU** to register items or **Box** to move a container. This is done by clicking the button in the **Movement Type** cell in the table above.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-07-04-120041.png)

            In this case, let's select **SKU**. If you selected **Box**, you can skip the step of scanning replenishment items by SKU.

            The first step is to **scan** the **PPL** or **Container** where the items needed for replenishment are located. Upon doing this, it will be reflected in the progress bar with a filled circle and a checkmark.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-114351.png)

            A success message will also appear at the top of the screen.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-114433.png)

            Next, **scan** the **QR** codes of the **items** that will be moved from the **location**. If you have 4 items to move, you must scan all 4 items.

            Once scanned, the progress will be noted when the table record turns green. Ensure that the same number of items to be moved as described in the order have been scanned. This can be checked in the **Quantity to be replenished** and **Scanned Quantity** columns.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-115027.png)

            Once all items have been scanned, click the menu in the bottom-right corner of the screen, which is a blue circle. This blue circle has 3 options, the last of which is an arrow labeled **Next**—click this to proceed to the next step.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-115605.png)

            Once this is done, the **progress** will be **reflected** in the **progress bar**, indicating that the **items** have been **scanned** and proceeding to the next step of **item location**.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-120021.png)

            Now scan the **location** of the items to complete this step. A **successful order** notification will appear at the top of the screen.

            To **complete** a replenishment **order**, click the **order completed** button.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-121020.png)

            Upon doing this, the order status changes to **Completed**, making the order unmodifiable.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-121324.png)

            This status is also **reflected** in the **replenishment orders** table.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-121530.png)
        </td>

### Process Replenishment Order with COO

:::note
    COO configuration was recently added. If you're looking for a configuration with COO, go to **[Customer Settings](./2025-05-23-Configuraciones_de_compañia.md)**.
:::

::::info[Extra Info]
    To use replenishment with COO, you need to understand how COO impacts replenishment.

    COO in replenishment adds the following:

    ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-07-04-124249.png)

    <table >
    <tr>
        <th>**No**</th>
        <th>**Name**</th>
        <th>**Description**</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>**1**</th>
        <th>Origin priority by country</th>
        <th>This box indicates whether COO priority is enabled for the company and therefore affects all replenishment and other dependent processes.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>**2**</th>
        <th>Configured countries</th>
        <th>If COO is enabled, there is a list of countries in order of priority, numbered from 1 to n, with 1 being the highest priority. This means items with COO in position 1 will be used first.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>**3**</th>
        <th>Single country per operation</th>
        <th>If this configuration is enabled, it means only one COO will be handled per replenishment order, meaning only one COO will be present in pick locations at a time.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>**4**</th>
        <th>Configuration summary</th>
        <th>This shows a simplified view of all the configurations mentioned above.</th>
    </tr>
</table>

**Example**

Eg. Rumble Inc. requires prioritizing CN - China: The replenishment process must prioritize restocking tasks by country of origin, and this functionality must be configured. 

Restocking will only apply if materials from China are depleted; then, picking locations can be restocked with materials from Thailand.

:::warning
    To add items of a different COO to a picking location, you must follow the **COO Change** rules. The most common one is: the location must be completely empty to make the change.

    For more information about these rules, **Link pending**.
:::

When **scanning** **items** for replenishment, the **new COO rules** must be considered.

These configurations can be **viewed** when performing **replenishment** by clicking the following **button**.

            First, create a **pending task** to indicate the item to be moved. **Click** on Pending **tasks**, located in the top-left corner as the first button.

            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-07-04-115914.png)

            Upon clicking, a **form** will appear where you will **specify** the **item** to move, the **quantity**, and the **zone**. The **zone** should only be entered if explicitly requested.

            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-06-05-115920.png)

            Next, select the **movement type** (**SKU** for items or **Box** for containers) by clicking the button in the **Movement Type** cell.
            
            ![](/img/upload/Screenshot-2025-07-04-120041.png)

            Let's select **SKU** (if you select **Box**, skip the item scanning step).

            First, **scan** the **PPL** or **Container** holding the items. This will be reflected in the progress bar.

## Tips and Tricks for This Module

If this happens, try reloading the page by pressing **F5** or the reload button in your browser.

If the problem persists, reload using the key combination **CTRL** + **R**. This will reset the site's cache. **Warning**: if you have unsent form data, it **may be lost**.

<hr/>

## Frequent Issues

### Items to Move Are Not Detected

When this happens, it is usually because the module flow was not followed: Assign the replenishment type (SKU or BOX) via the **button** in the **Movement Type** cell in the order processing table. To switch between **SKU** and **Box**, simply **click** the **button**.

![Replenishment table](/img/upload/screenshot-2025-06-05-103956.png "Movement Type")

**Box** is used if you want to move containers to that location.

![](/img/upload/screenshot-2025-06-05-104005.png)

**SKU** is used if you want to move **items** directly to the location.

### An Item Is Not Detected When Scanned

This may happen for the following reasons:

1. You **have not scanned** the **source container** as the **first step**.
2. You are entering an **incorrect SKU** or item code. Please **verify** the number is correct.
3. The **item** you are entering already has **full stock** or **no longer exists**.
