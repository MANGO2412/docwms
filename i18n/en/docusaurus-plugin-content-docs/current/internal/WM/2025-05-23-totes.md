# Totes

This module handles the management of totes (trays) for each warehouse, detailing the necessary actions to register, update, delete, and view their information.

Totes are important in the WMS, where they are assigned to orders generated in the Order Monitor module, allowing the corresponding items to be located to fulfill those orders.

## Generate a Tote

- Click on the **CREATE TOTE** option to start the process.

    2. Then, select the size of the Tote, which defines the number of Trays it can contain. In this example, the **Medium** size is selected. When choosing a size, the **Total trays calculated** field will automatically display the number of Trays corresponding to that configuration.

If the Tote is selected as **Preconfigured**, it means you want to manually define its size configuration.

When doing so, several additional fields will appear. First, you must select the **Tray Size**, which should have been previously created in the Tray module, under the Create Size option. For this example, the **115.08-IN-LARGE** size is selected.

Next, specify the number of Trays the Tote will contain **horizontally** and **vertically**.

Based on these parameters, the **Total trays calculated** field will automatically display the total number of Trays the Tote will have according to the established configuration.
