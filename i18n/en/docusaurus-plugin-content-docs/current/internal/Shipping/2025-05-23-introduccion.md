# Introduction to Shipping

The **Shipping** section represents the final stage within the WMS system. At this stage, packages grouped into pallets are prepared based on the purchase orders generated in the **Order Monitor** module, with the purpose of being dispatched and delivered to clients.

The modules involved in this workflow are:

- **Bin**: This module allows the management of bins, which are groupings of packages assigned a tracking number. It also displays related information such as the bin type (pallet or box), the assigned import rule, and other relevant data.

- **Shipping**: In this module, shipping orders are generated. It allows associating these orders with the previously processed bins, assigning the corresponding carrier, and checking the current status of each order.
