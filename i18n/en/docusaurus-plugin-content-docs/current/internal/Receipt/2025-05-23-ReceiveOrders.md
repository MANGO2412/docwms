# Receive Orders

This module allows the creation and management of receipt orders corresponding to packages sent by the client. Its main purpose is to register each merchandise reception into the WMS system, ensuring precise control over incoming products. Through this module, the entire process of packages entering the warehouse is managedâ€”from physical reception to validation and system registration.

## Create a Receipt

:::note

When the receipt order is created, its default status is **Created**, meaning the process is not yet completed because the packages haven't been validated through entry and verification. For example:

![](/img/upload/receiveOrdersp5-2025-13-16.png)

To complete the process, you must first generate the PPL. Then, scan the PPLs in the **Receive Orders Picking** module to validate the received packages. Once these steps are completed, the receipt order status will change from **Created** to **Completed**, concluding the process.
