# Introduction.

The **Receipt** section is a fundamental part of the WMS system, as it encompasses the entire process of receiving packages sent by clients to the warehouse. This section contains the key modules that manage each stage of the receiving process, from pre-notification to the final validation of items.

The modules included are:
- **Shipping Notice**: Allows the creation and management of ASNs (Advanced Shipping Notices), where detailed information about the items to be received is provided.

- **Receive Orders**: Enables the creation of receipt orders, which serve as the initial records of the process. In this module, PPLs (Packing List Labels) are generated for the incoming packages.

- **Receive Orders Picking**: In this module, previously generated PPLs are scanned, the received packages are validated, and their status within the system is verified.
