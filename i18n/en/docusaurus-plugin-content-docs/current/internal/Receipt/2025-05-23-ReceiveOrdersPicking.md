# Receive Orders Picking

In this module, you scan the **PPLs (Packing List Labels)** previously generated in the [Receive Orders](./2025-05-23-ReceiveOrders.md#print-ppl-labels) module. Its main purpose is to validate the item information inside received packages, ensuring it matches what was recorded, and to facilitate accurate receiving control within the WMS system.

## Scan the PPLs

- After generating and printing the PPLs from the [Receive Orders](./2025-05-23-ReceiveOrders.md#print-ppl-labels) module, as shown in the image below, make sure you have all the documents ready for scanning.

- Use the scanner provided to you as a work tool and scan the QR code printed on each PPL. In this example, the package **PPL 1747166020003** associated with receipt **R-00000246** will be scanned.

- Next, the system will validate the existence of the PPL in the database. If the information is correct, the associated receipt details will be displayed, along with a form requesting the following data to continue the process.

- Afterward, a QR code will be generated including the **Tracking Number** and other relevant package data. This code will be used to identify the package inside the warehouse. Print the label and attach it directly to the scanned package.

- To validate that the changes were successfully saved, go to the [Receive Orders](./2025-05-23-ReceiveOrders.md) module and select the corresponding receipt. Then, review the PPL section and make sure the scanned PPL contains the correct registered information, as shown below.
