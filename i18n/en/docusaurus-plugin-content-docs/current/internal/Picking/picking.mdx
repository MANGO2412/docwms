      **Totes** or carts contain **trays**, which in turn store the items to be packed.

      **Trays** are individual units that contain items. Each tray has a code that must be scanned to start the process in the **Validator** module.

      1. Tap the **Picking button (1)** and **scan a tote** using the Zebra scanner to begin working with orders.
      2. **Scan the trays** to assign them to the tote that will be used in the picking process.

      3. Next, the system will ask you to **scan the location** where the items are located. The location code will appear in **black** letters with the "**MULTI**" legend.

      4. An **interface** will be displayed showing the item and the quantity to be picked from the location. To proceed, **scan the items** one by one.

        Depending on client needs, the view shown above may be modified by specific configurations defined in the **[Company Settings](../WM/2025-05-23-Configuraciones_de_compaÃ±ia)** section.
        From that section, it's possible to enable or disable different elements that determine what information will be visible in the picker application.
        These options are usually adapted to the particular requirements of each client â€” for example, companies like Tumble â€” and allow control over details such as whether the country of origin (COO), lot number, UPC, description, or product image are displayed, among others, as shown in the following image.
        <img src="/img/upload/Pickingp1-2025-13-16.png" width="300px"/>

        Additionally, if the client has COO and/or lot number display enabled, the application will show this information only if it exists in the item data.

      5. Once **all items** in the order have been scanned, **scan the tray again** where they will be temporarily stored.

      6. Finally, the order will be marked as **completed**. The trays with the items must be **delivered to the packing area**.
