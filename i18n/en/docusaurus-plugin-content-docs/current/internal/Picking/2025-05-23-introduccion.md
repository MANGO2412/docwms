**Picking** is one of the most critical processes within the **G-WMS** ecosystem, as it enables the precise and efficient preparation of items that make up a customer order. This process is executed directly through the WMS mobile application, designed to guide operational staff step by step during the locating, picking, and consolidation of products in the warehouse.  

Through this app, various modules work together to ensure smooth and reliable operations. Below are the main modules described:  

### Movements  

The **Movements** module is essential for the proper distribution of packages or items within the warehouse. It allows inventory to be moved between locations, such as:  

- From **Over Storage** to **Pick Location** or **Multi SKU Location**, especially when restocking picking zones.  
- Relocating packages received from the receiving area.  
- Executing **replenishment** tasks to ensure picking zones are always stocked when inventory is available in other warehouse areas.  

This module ensures that items are in the right place at the right time, which is key to efficient picking.  

### Picking  

The **Picking** module is the core of the operational workflow when fulfilling customer orders. Here, staff:  

- Scan **totes** and **trays** (picking trays) that will be used to collect items.  
- Scan physical **locations** in the warehouse to retrieve requested products.  
- Scan each **item** to confirm accurate picking according to the order.  
- Consolidate picked items into trays, which are then moved to the **packing** area.  

The system can display configurable information such as **UPC**, **lot number**, **country of origin**, **product image**, and more, based on client preferences.  

Efficient picking reduces mispicking errors, improves delivery times, and ensures greater end-customer satisfaction.  

### Seeker  

The **Seeker** module allows staff to query real-time information about different warehouse elements by scanning a QR or barcode. Users can check:  

- **Locations**: To verify which items are in a specific location.  
- **Containers**: To inspect the contents of large boxes holding multiple units.  
- **Trays and totes**: To track their movement or usage in picking operations.  
- **Items**: To obtain details such as their location, available quantity, and inventory status.  

This module is crucial for inventory control, traceability, and audits.
