# Order Monitors (Client Portal)

The **Order Monitor module** is a key section within the WMS system that allows you to view, manage, and monitor the status of purchase orders that need to be fulfilled in the warehouse. Its main function is to provide real-time control over every stage of the logistics process, from order creation to completion.
